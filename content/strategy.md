# Smart Home Web Application

### Overview

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for a mock smart home web application. The application simulates a user interface (UI) and backend server for managing smart devices (lights, outlets, circuit breakers), creating automation rules, and accessing device status remotely.

The goal is to ensure a high-quality user experience with core features.

## Objectives

- Validate functionality on critical user workflows
- Ensure consistent device feedback and device state accuracy
- Establish automated end-to-end tests for early and continuous quality assurance

## Scope

- Web UI
- Backend simulation / API testing
- Automation logic
- Responsive / mobile view behavior BONUS
- Automated test execution using Playwright
- Integration testing with Github Actions

## Out of Scope

- Authenticated cloud service for off-site device control
- Real-time IoT protocol testing
- Security testing

## Features to test

- ON/OFF switch
- Dimmer Switch
- Scene Picker
- Circuit Breaker switches and breaker status communication
- Automations (lights on at sunset)

## Test types

use table??

- Functional (automated and manual) - ensure behavior matches requirements
- Integration - validate new contributions integrate with production code
- E2E - simulate user flows in multiple browser environments

## Tools

use table??

- Playwright for end-to-end browser testing
- Github Actions for CI workflow
- Nuxt framework for mock smart home application

## Environment

- Local development server
- Chromium, Firefox, and Webkit browsers

## Requirements

| **Requirement**                                                                   | **Test Areas**             |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Users must see a dashboard with devices                                           | Device Control             |
| Users must be able to toggle device state (ON/OFF, dimming)                       | Device Control             |
| Users can create, update, and delete automation rules                             | Automations                |
| Automations should trigger at scheduled times, changing device states             | Automation Execution       |
| The app should handle network/API failures gracefully (e.g., show error messages) | Error Handling             |
| The UI must adapt responsively to various screen sizes                            | Responsive Design          |
| The test suite must be executable via CI/CD on push/PR                            | Automation, CI Integration |

## Test Coverage Outline

### Device control

- Show connected devices (on- and offline)
- Toggle devices ON/OFF, dim to target intensity
- Device state feedback
- Handle offline device error

### Automations

- Create schedule based automation
- Create, edit, and delete automations
- Trigger automation
- Prevent invalid automation

### TODO

- add some to match the requirements section

## Reporting

- Console
- HTML reports
- Screenshots on pass and failure

## Defect Tracking

- GitHub issues

## Success criteria

- 100% on high priority cases
- Zero critical bugs

## Future Enhancements

- Cloud server integration for authenticated, off-site device control
- Accessibility tests
- Expand for edge cases

## Documentation

- User stories
